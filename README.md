# üõ°Ô∏è Apex Financials ‚Äì Incident Response Report (Part 1 & Part 2)

This repository documents two separate but high-impact cybersecurity incidents that occurred at Apex Financials. These incidents were investigated using industry-standard tools (Splunk, Wireshark, IDS, firewall analysis) and mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

## üîç Part 1: ShadowCrypt Ransomware Attack (INC250306)

- Initial Vector: Spear-phishing email with malicious PDF
- Target: WORKSTATION-01 (`apexfinancial\analyst1`)
- Execution Technique: Malicious macro (MITRE T1204.002)
- Credential Compromise: Brute force, pass-the-hash attack (T1110, T1550.002)
- Lateral Movement: WMI, PsExec
- Final Payload: ShadowCrypt ransomware on `192.168.1.200`
- Persistence: Scheduled tasks created for long-term access (T1053.005)
- IOCs:
  - Malicious PDF: `Q1 Performance Review.pdf`
  - C2 IP: `185.143.223.47`
  - Registry & Scheduled Task modifications
- Business Impact: Operational disruption, IP theft risk, loss of financial records

## üîé Part 2: Web Server Compromise & Data Exfiltration (INC250422)

- Initial Entry: Brute-force login to `/login.php`
- Exploitation:
  - SQL Injection
  - File upload of `c99shell.php` and `eval-stdin.php`
- Command Execution: `cmd=ls`, `cmd=whoami` via PHP shell
- Data Exfiltration:
  - Over 50GB of sensitive data exfiltrated to `167.172.3.114`
  - Included `db_config.php`, `backup.tar.gz`, and `.csv/.xls` files
- Logs Analyzed:
  - `access.log`
  - `IDS_logs.txt`
  - `FW_logs.txt`
- Mapped MITRE Techniques:
  - T1110 ‚Äì Brute Force
  - T1505.003 ‚Äì Web Shell
  - T1059.003 ‚Äì PHP Execution
  - T1041 ‚Äì Exfiltration over HTTP

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques Used

- Splunk: Log query correlation and timeline reconstruction
- Firewall and IDS logs: Confirmed exploitation and data movement
- YARA / ClamAV / Sysmon / Wazuh: Detection and containment (simulated)
- Security Onion: Perimeter telemetry
- PowerShell & Linux CLI: Forensic preservation, system hardening

---

## üìë Lessons Learned

- Spear-phishing must be countered with advanced email filtering and training
- Input validation, WAF, and PHP hardening are critical for web apps
- MFA and endpoint telemetry must be enforced for all privileged systems
- Forensic readiness (image capture, log hashing) is essential for incident response
